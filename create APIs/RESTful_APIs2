---   How Client and Server Communicate

---   Suppose we have a server and a client.

---   How do they communicate?

The client sends a request, and the server responds based on the request.

There are certain rules and standards for this communication, which RESTful APIs provide.


Communication Flow :

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SERVER        >>>>>>        CLIENT        >>>>>>        Response

CLIENT        >>>>>>        SERVER        >>>>>>        Request

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Rule 1: Server-Client Architecture

---   RESTful APIs work on server-client architecture.

This means the server and client are different machines and should not depend on each other.


---   Example :

---   A GET request is made to fetch some blogs.
---   The server retrieves the blogs from the database.
---   The server converts the data into an HTML document.
---   The HTML document is sent to the client as a response.

The HTML document generated is known as SSR (Server-Side Rendering).


---   Database Interaction Flow:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SERVER        >>>>>>        DATABASE        >>>>>>        Request

DATABASE      >>>>>>        SERVER          >>>>>>        Response

------------------------------------------------------------------------
