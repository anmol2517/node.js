How Node.js Works :
Node.js operates on a "single-threaded event loop" model with a "non-blocking I/O" architecture. Here’s how it handles client requests:

---

Request Flow :

1. Client Request  
   - User 1 sends a request → It goes to the "Event Queue".
   - User 2 sends a request → It also goes to the "Event Queue".

2. Event Queue
   - A queue where all incoming requests are lined up (FIFO - First In, First Out).

3. Event Loop
   - The "Event Loop" continuously monitors the "Event Queue".  
   - Based on the type of request, it decides whether to:
     - "Directly process the request" (for non-blocking operations).  
     - "Send it to the Thread Pool" (for blocking operations).

Types of Requests :

1. Non-Blocking Operations (Asynchronous)
   - Example: Database queries, file reads, API calls.  
   - The Event Loop handles these directly and efficiently.  
   - Once the operation completes, the result is returned to the user.

2. Blocking Operations (Synchronous)
   - Example: CPU-intensive tasks, file compression, encryption, etc.  
   - The Event Loop assigns the request to a worker in the "Thread Pool" (via "libuv") for processing.  
   - After the worker completes the task, the result is returned to the Event Loop and sent to the user.

Thread Pool :
   - "libuv", the library that powers Node.js, manages a pool of threads (default size: 4).  
   - These threads handle blocking tasks so the main thread (Event Loop) remains free.


---


Summary :
- Non-blocking operations: Processed directly by the Event Loop.  
- Blocking operations : Delegated to the "Thread Pool", processed by workers, then the response is returned to the Event Loop.  
- Node.js achieves high scalability by handling non-blocking tasks efficiently and delegating blocking tasks appropriately.

This flow ensures that Node.js can handle multiple requests concurrently without being blocked by any single operation.
